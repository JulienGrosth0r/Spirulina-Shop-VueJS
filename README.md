# Learning Vue.js (SPA)
This project was made to learn how to code using Vue.js, specifically coding a Single Page Application.  
Throughout this project, I learnt how to navigate and use the Vue.js framework; understanding its organization, initializing a new Vue project, creating and using components, client-side routing and navigation, using APIs (specifically for the suppliers and their stock), integrating a mapping library to the website, and much more!

### The suppliers and their interactive stock, which dynamically evolves when modified:
